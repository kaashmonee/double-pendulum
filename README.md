# pendulum

This will be simulating a double pendulum. 
A double pendulum is a piece of mass attached to another piece of mass via a piece of rigid wire or string.
The equations of motion for the double pendulum are derived via the Lagrangian formalism in which the time derivative of the partial derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocity subtracted by the partial derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the generalized x is equal to zero. 
As a result, one gets coupled second order differential equations whose solutions are the equations of motion for the pendulum. 
Thanks for taking a gander.
Some guy on the internet made one also and some inspiration is taken from him. 
OK. Bye
